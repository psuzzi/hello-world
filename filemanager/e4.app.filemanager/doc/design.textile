If you want to add a status bar, your best bet is to add a ToolControl to the TrimBar. You would provide a class to instantiate your status bar, and we use the class org.eclipse.jface.action.StatusLineManager to actually render the status line in the 4.2 Workbench.  

Trimbars > Window Trim - Bottom > ToolControl

Use IEventBroker to share the status between MParts. Have the parts publish events and have the status provide a listener to update accordingly.
