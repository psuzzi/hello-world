p(description). Contribution to E4 Tools codebase explained. 

h2. Intro

Contribution is mainly done by fixing bugzilla bugs and pushing the "resolution" to a git repository. 

There are 4 main steps: 
# *Select a Bug*: select a bug on using bugzilla and follow the discussion
# *Prepare the Environment*: Git-clone the source code, solve compilation errors, and run. 
# *Error reproduction and Bug fix*: reproduce the error, and fix the bug
# *Contribute*: create a Git-patch or commit with Gerrit / Git.
 
h3. Notes & Prerequisites:

In this article is shown how to contribute to the Eclipse E4 Tooling Project. Different projects have different contribution workflows
We need to use Git to fetch and push the code. The simple way s to dowbload a version of Eclipse for Committers.


h2. Select a Bug
 
Eclipse bugs are listed on "bugzilla web page":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/ .To select all open bugs on Eclipse E4 Tools, we perform an Advanced Search, filtering for bugs in Eclipse > e4 > Tools which status in UNCONFIRMED, NEW, ASSIGNED, REOPENED.
