h3. Create E4 project

Create a new E4 project and name it e4.test 
@CTRL+N@ > *Eclipse E4 Application Project*. 
We don't need an activator, so we give the name, press *Next*, and Finish.

Open the e4.test.product, and click on launch an Eclipse application. You'll see an empty shell with the application title.

Now edit the Application.e4xmi, by adding a Part, directly under the Windows and Dialogs > Controls > Part. 
Then click on the Class URI link, to launch the wizard for the creation of the part.
