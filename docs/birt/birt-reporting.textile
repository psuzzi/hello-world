h2. Introduction to BIRT

BIRT is an open source technology platform used to create data visualization and reports that can be embedded into rich client and web applications. 

Open source BIRT has two main components:
* Visual Report Designer : for creating BIRT designs
* Runtime component : for generating content that can be deployed at any Java environment

The open source BIRT also includes a _charting engine_ that is fully integrated into the *Visual Report designer*, and it can be used itself to incorporate charts into the applications. 
BIRT design are saved as XML files, and can access multiple industry standard data soruces at the same time. 

With BIRT is also possible to generate report and charts programmatically. But this is an advanced topic covered by another "article":BIRT-chart-report-programmatically.textile

h2. Setup BIRT developer's tools

The easy way to work with BIRT developer's tools is to download the latest version of the Eclipse IDE for Java and Report developers.
 
For those who have a custom developent environment, it is better to install the BIRT Framework, from Menu > Install New Software . In this case you'll need to select the Birt Framework from the current Eclipse Update site, or to put manually the update site ULR ("see how":https://wiki.eclipse.org/BIRT_Update_Site_URL)

After restarting eclipse, we can test the resport designer, by creating a new report. 

h2. Test BIRT Reporting

To test BIRT reporting we'll need to create a new Report Design and feed it with new data.
